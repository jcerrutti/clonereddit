## Decisions taken

According to the time limit that I had to complete this challenge, I prioritized the functionality over the look & feel. Because that, it lacks responsive design and only looks good on desktop resolutions.
Also, I decided to not go for the pagination and have all the posts loaded on the list.

My goal was to respect the time and days limit and I achieved this code in approx. 5 hours, like the requirement, said.
